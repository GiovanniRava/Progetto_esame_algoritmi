My exam project for Algorithm and Data Structure. 
Teacher: Luciano Margara, Moreno Marzolla.
The algorithm I implemented takes the file name as input, as per the standard, and then retrieves all the necessary data from the file to create a graph.
Dijkstra's algorithm is then used to calculate the shortest paths, computed using the formula provided by the professor.
Finally, I display the entire path on the screen and also the total cost

There are every input test file and expected output file given by the teacher.
